# Ceres Emulator AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

Ceres is an experimental Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance
emulator written in Rust. It is designed with a modular architecture,
separating the core emulation logic from the frontend implementations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several Rust crates, each with a specific
responsibility:

- `ceres-core`: The heart of the emulator. It contains the hardware emulation
  logic, including:
  - SM83 CPU (`sm83.rs`)
  - Audio Processing Unit (APU) (`apu/`)
  - Pixel Processing Unit (PPU) (`ppu/`)
  - Memory Management (`memory/`)
  - Cartridge handling (`cartridge/`)
  - This crate is designed to be `no_std` compatible, allowing it to run on a
    wide range of platforms.

- `ceres-std`: Provides standard library-dependent functionalities for desktop
    and mobile frontends (Android), such as:
  - Audio playback (`audio.rs`)
  - Threading (`thread.rs`)
  - A WebGPU-based renderer (`wgpu_renderer/`) used by the `winit`, `egui` and
    Android frontends.

- `ceres-winit`: A minimal, cross-platform CLI frontend using `winit` for
  windowing. It renders the emulator screen but offers no GUI controls.

- `ceres-egui`: A cross-platform frontend built with the `egui` immediate-mode
  GUI library.

- `ceres-gtk`: A Linux-focused frontend using GTK4 for its user interface.

- `ceres-android/`: The Android application project.
- `ceres-ndk/`: JNI bindings to expose the `ceres-core` functionality to the
  Android application.

- `gb-bootroms/`: Contains the source code and build scripts for the Game Boy
  boot ROMs used by the emulator.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- **Rust Toolchain**: Required for building all Rust crates.
- **RGBDS**: The [RGBDS toolchain](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/) is needed to
  assemble the boot ROMs located in `gb-bootroms/`.

### Build Steps

1. Initialize Git submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
2. Build the boot ROMs: `cd gb-bootroms && make`
3. Select the default frontend in the root `Cargo.toml` file. For example, to
   use the GTK frontend, set `default-members = ["ceres-gtk"]`.
4. Build the project: `cargo build`
5. Run the selected frontend: `cargo run`

## Key Resources and Standards

- **Gold Standard Emulator**: We use [SameBoy](https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy)
  as the reference for correct emulation behavior. In cases of ambiguity,
  SameBoy's implementation is considered the ground truth.
- **Hardware Documentation**: The
  [Pan Docs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/) wiki is the primary reference for Game
  Boy hardware specifications, memory maps, and programming details.
